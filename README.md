# Typst-templates-for-UCPH
Typst templates for the University of Copenhagen. (Pre-alpha stage?)

This is a "showcase" repo to show how to use the templates.

The plan is to keep template with their own repo to publish this on Typst Universe.

- [Posters](https://github.com/jorgenhost/ucph_TypstPoster): Template for creating academic posters, based on [Peace of Posters](https://github.com/jonaspleyer/peace-of-posters)
